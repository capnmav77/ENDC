 weekâs work. It
was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
not risk the loss of it.

âEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with
diligence that I might get on to the Bâs before very long. It cost me
something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.â

âTo an end?â

âYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
at ten oâclock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
it is, and you can read for yourself.â

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
note-paper. It read in this fashion:

âTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.â


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
of laughter.

âI cannot see that there is anything very funny,â cried our client,
flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. âIf you can do nothing
better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.â

âNo, no,â cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
had half risen. âI really wouldnât miss your case for the world. It is
most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
take when you found the card upon the door?â

âI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
name was new to him.

ââWell,â said I, âthe gentleman at No. 4.â

ââWhat, the red-headed man?â

ââYes.â

ââOh,â said he, âhis name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and
was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
were ready. He moved out yesterday.â

ââWhere could I find him?â

ââOh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King
Edward Street, near St. Paulâs.â

âI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.â

âAnd what did you do then?â asked Holmes.

âI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
who were in need of it, I came right away to you.â

âAnd you did very wisely,â said Holmes. âYour case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at first sight appear.â

âGrave enough!â said Mr. Jabez Wilson. âWhy, I have lost four pound a
week.â

âAs far as you are personally concerned,â remarked Holmes, âI do not
see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.â

âNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
their object was in playing this prankâif it was a prankâupon me. It
was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
pounds.â

âWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
your attention to the advertisementâhow long had he been with you?â

âAbout a month then.â

âHow did he come?â

âIn answer to an advertisement.â

âWas he the only applicant?â

âNo, I had a dozen.â

âWhy did you pick him?â

âBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â

âAt half wages, in fact.â

âYes.â

âWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?â

âSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though heâs not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
forehead.â

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. âI thought as
much,â said he. âHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?â

âYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.â

âHum!â said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. âHe is still with
you?â

âOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â

âAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â

âNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâs never very much to do of a
morning.â

âThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â

âWell, Watson,â said Holmes when our visitor had left us, âwhat do you
make of it all?â

âI make nothing of it,â I answered frankly. âIt is a most mysterious
business.â

âAs a rule,â said Holmes, âthe more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.â

âWhat are you going to do, then?â I asked.

âTo smoke,â he answered. âIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg
that you wonât speak to me for fifty minutes.â He curled himself up in
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

âSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâs Hall this afternoon,â he remarked.
âWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a fe weekâs work. It
was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.

âI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.â

âAnd what did you do then?â asked Holmes.

âI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
who were in need of it, I came right away to you.â

âAnd you did very wisely,â said Holmes. âYour case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at first sight appear.â

âGrave enough!â said Mr. Jabez Wilson. âWhy, I have lost four pound a
week.â

âAs far as you are personally concerned,â remarked Holmes, âI do not
see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.â

âNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
their object was in playing this prankâif it was a prankâupon me. It
was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
pounds.â

âWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
your attention to the advertisementâhow long had he been with you?â

âAbout a month then.â

âHow did he come?â

âIn answer to an advertisement.â

âWas he the only applicant?â

âNo, I had a dozen.â

âWhy did you pick him?â

âBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â

âAt half wages, in fact.â

âYes.â

âWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?â

âSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though heâs not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
forehead.â

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. âI thought as
much,â said he. âHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?â

âYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.â

âHum!â said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. âHe is still with
you?â

âOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â

âAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â

âNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâs never very much to do of a
morning.â

âThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â

âWell, Watson,â said Holmes when our visitor had left us, âwhat do you
make of it all?â

âI make nothing of it,â I answered frankly. âIt is a most mysterious
business.â

âAs a rule,â said Holmes, âthe more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.â

âWhat are you going to do, then?â I asked.

âTo smoke,â he answered. âIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg
that you wonât speak to me for fifty minutes.â He curled himself up in
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

âSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâs Hall this afternoon,â he remarked.
âWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a fe weekâs work. It
was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
not risk the loss of it.

âEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with
diligence that I might get on to the Bâs before very long. It cost me
something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.â

âTo an end?â

âYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
at ten oâclock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
it is, and you can read for yourself.â

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
note-paper. It read in this fashion:

âTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.â


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
of laughter.

âI cannot see that there is anything very funny,â cried our client,
flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. âIf you can do nothing
better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.â

âNo, no,â cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
had half risen. âI really wouldnât miss your case for the world. It is
most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
take when you found the card upon the door?â

âI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
name was new to him.

ââWell,â said I, âthe gentleman at No. 4.â

ââWhat, the red-headed man?â

ââYes.â

ââOh,â said he, âhis name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and
was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
were ready. He moved out yesterday.â

ââWhere could I find him?â

ââOh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King

âHum!â said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. âHe is still with
you?â

âOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â

âAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â

âNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâs never very much to do of a
morning.â

âThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â

âWell, Watson,â said Holmes when our visitor had left us, âwhat do you
make of it all?â

âI make nothing of it,â I answered frankly. âIt is a most mysterious
business.â

âAs a rule,â said Holmes, âthe more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.â

âWhat are you going to do, then?â I asked.

âTo smoke,â he answered. âIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg
that you wonât speak to me for fifty minutes.â He curled himself up in
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

âSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâs Hall this afternoon,â he remarked.
âWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a fe weekâs work. It
was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
not risk the loss of it.

âEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with
diligence that I might get on to the Bâs before very long. It cost me
something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.â

âTo an end?â

âYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
at ten oâclock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
it is, and you can read for yourself.â

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
note-paper. It read in this fashion:

âTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.â


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
of laughter.

âI cannot see that there is anything very funny,â cried our client,
flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. âIf you can do nothing
better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.â

âNo, no,â cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
had half risen. âI really wouldnât miss your case for the world. It is
most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
take when you found the card upon the door?â

âI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
name was new to him.

ââWell,â said I, âthe gentleman at No. 4.â

ââWhat, the red-headed man?â

ââYes.â

ââOh,â said he, âhis name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and
was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
were ready. He moved out yesterday.â

ââWhere could I find him?â

ââOh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King
Edward Street, near St. Paulâs.â

âI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.â

âAnd what did you do then?â asked Holmes.

âI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
who were in need of it, I came right away to you.â

âAnd you did very wisely,â said Holmes. âYour case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at first sight appear.â

âGrave enough!â said Mr. Jabez Wilson. âWhy, I have lost four pound a
week.â

âAs far as you are personally concerned,â remarked Holmes, âI do not
see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.â

âNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
their object was in playing this prankâif it was a prankâupon me. It
was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
pounds.â

âWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
your attention to the advertisementâhow long had he been with you?â

âAbout a month then.â

âHow did he come?â

âIn answer to an advertisement.â

âWas he the only applicant?â

âNo, I had a dozen.â

âWhy did you pick him?â

âBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â

âAt half wages, in fact.â

âYes.â

âWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?â

âSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though heâs not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
forehead.â

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. âI thought as
much,â said he. âHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?â

âYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.â

âHum!â said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. âHe is still with
you?â

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
note-paper. It read in this fashion:

âTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.â


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
of laughter.

âI cannot see that there is anything very funny,â cried our client,
flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. âIf you can do nothing
better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.â

âNo, no,â cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
had half risen. âI really wouldnât miss your case for the world. It is
most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
take when you found the card upon the door?â

âI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
name was new to him.

ââWell,â said I, âthe gentleman at No. 4.â

ââWhat, the red-headed man?â

ââYes.â

ââOh,â said he, âhis name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and
was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
were ready. He moved out yesterday.â

ââWhere could I find him?â

ââOh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King
Edward Street, near St. Paulâs.â

âI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.â

âAnd what did you do then?â asked Holmes.

âI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
who were in need of it, I came right away to you.â

âAnd you did very wisely,â said Holmes. âYour case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at first sight appear.â

âGrave enough!â said Mr. Jabez Wilson. âWhy, I have lost four pound a
week.â

âAs far as you are personally concerned,â remarked Holmes, âI do not
see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.â

âNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
their object was in playing this prankâif it was a prankâupon me. It
was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
pounds.â

âWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
your attention to the advertisementâhow long had he been with you?â

âAbout a month then.â

âHow did he come?â

âIn answer to an advertisement.â

âWas he the only applicant?â

âNo, I had a dozen.â

âWhy did you pick him?â

âBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â

âAt half wages, in fact.â

âYes.â

âWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?â

âSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though heâs not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
forehead.â

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. âI thought as
much,â said he. âHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?â

âYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.â

âHum!â said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. âHe is still with
you?â

âOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â

âAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â

âNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâs never very much to do of a
morning.â

âThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â

âWell, Watson,â said Holmes when our visitor had left us, âwhat do you
make of it all?â

âI make nothing of it,â I answered frankly. âIt is a most mysterious
business.â

âAs a rule,â said Holmes, âthe more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.â

âWhat are you going to do, then?â I asked.

âTo smoke,â he answered. âIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg
that you wonât speak to me for fifty minutes.â He curled himself up in
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

âSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâs Hall this afternoon,â he remarked.
âWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a fe weekâs work. It
was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
not risk the loss of it.

âEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with
diligence that I might get on to the Bâs before very long. It cost me
something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.â

âTo an end?â

âYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
at ten oâclock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
it is, and you can read for yourself.â

âGrave enough!â said Mr. Jabez Wilson. âWhy, I have lost four pound a
week.â

âAs far as you are personally concerned,â remarked Holmes, âI do not
see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.â

âNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
their object was in playing this prankâif it was a prankâupon me. It
was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
pounds.â

âWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
your attention to the advertisementâhow long had he been with you?â

âAbout a month then.â

âHow did he come?â

âIn answer to an advertisement.â

âWas he the only applicant?â

âNo, I had a dozen.â

âWhy did you pick him?â

âBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â

âAt half wages, in fact.â

âYes.â

âWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?â

âSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though heâs not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
forehead.â

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. âI thought as
much,â said he. âHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?â

âYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.â

âHum!â said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. âHe is still with
you?â

âOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â

âAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â

âNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâs never very much to do of a
morning.â

âThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â

âWell, Watson,â said Holmes when our visitor had left us, âwhat do you
make of it all?â

âI make nothing of it,â I answered frankly. âIt is a most mysterious
business.â

âAs a rule,â said Holmes, âthe more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.â

âWhat are you going to do, then?â I asked.

âTo smoke,â he answered. âIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg
that you wonât speak to me for fifty minutes.â He curled himself up in
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

âSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâs Hall this afternoon,â he remarked.
âWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a fe weekâs work. It
was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
not risk the loss of it.

âEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with
diligence that I might get on to the Bâs before very long. It cost me
something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.â

âTo an end?â

âYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
at ten oâclock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
it is, and you can read for yourself.â

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
note-paper. It read in this fashion:

âTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.â


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
of laughter.

âI cannot see that there is anything very funny,â cried our client,
flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. âIf you can do nothing
better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.â

âNo, no,â cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
had half risen. âI really wouldnât miss your case for the world. It is
most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
take when you found the card upon the door?â

âI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
name was new to him.

ââWell,â said I, âthe gentleman at No. 4.â

ââWhat, the red-headed man?â

ââYes.â

ââOh,â said he, âhis name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and
was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
were ready. He moved out yesterday.â

ââWhere could I find him?â

ââOh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King
Edward Street, near St. Paulâs.â

âI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.â

âAnd what did you do then?â asked Holmes.

âI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
who were in need of it, I came right away to you.â

âAnd you did very wisely,â said Holmes. âYour case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at first sight appear.â

âGrave enough!â said Mr. Jabez Wilson. âWhy, I have lost four pound a

which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.â

âWhat are you going to do, then?â I asked.

âTo smoke,â he answered. âIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg
that you wonât speak to me for fifty minutes.â He curled himself up in
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

âSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâs Hall this afternoon,â he remarked.
âWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a fe weekâs work. It
was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
not risk the loss of it.

âEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with
diligence that I might get on to the Bâs before very long. It cost me
something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.â

âTo an end?â

âYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
at ten oâclock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
it is, and you can read for yourself.â

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
note-paper. It read in this fashion:

âTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.â


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
of laughter.

âI cannot see that there is anything very funny,â cried our client,
flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. âIf you can do nothing
better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.â

âNo, no,â cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
had half risen. âI really wouldnât miss your case for the world. It is
most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
take when you found the card upon the door?â

âI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
name was new to him.

ââWell,â said I, âthe gentleman at No. 4.â

ââWhat, the red-headed man?â

ââYes.â

ââOh,â said he, âhis name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and
was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
were ready. He moved out yesterday.â

ââWhere could I find him?â

ââOh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King
Edward Street, near St. Paulâs.â

âI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.â

âAnd what did you do then?â asked Holmes.

âI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
who were in need of it, I came right away to you.â

âAnd you did very wisely,â said Holmes. âYour case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at first sight appear.â

âGrave enough!â said Mr. Jabez Wilson. âWhy, I have lost four pound a
week.â

âAs far as you are personally concerned,â remarked Holmes, âI do not
see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.â

âNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
their object was in playing this prankâif it was a prankâupon me. It
was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
pounds.â

âWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
your attention to the advertisementâhow long had he been with you?â

âAbout a month then.â

âHow did he come?â

âIn answer to an advertisement.â

âWas he the only applicant?â

âNo, I had a dozen.â

âWhy did you pick him?â

âBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â

âAt half wages, in fact.â

âYes.â

âWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?â

âSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though heâs not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
forehead.â

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. âI thought as
much,â said he. âHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?â

âYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.â

âHum!â said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. âHe is still with
you?â

âOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â

âAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â

âNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâs never very much to do of a
morning.â

âThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â

âWell, Watson,â said Holmes when our visitor had left us, âwhat do you
make of it all?â

âI make nothing of it,â I answered frankly. âIt is a most mysterious
business.â

âAs a rule,â said Holmes, âthe more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most

âI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such
body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the
name was new to him.

ââWell,â said I, âthe gentleman at No. 4.â

ââWhat, the red-headed man?â

ââYes.â

ââOh,â said he, âhis name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and
was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
were ready. He moved out yesterday.â

ââWhere could I find him?â

ââOh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King
Edward Street, near St. Paulâs.â

âI started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a
manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.â

âAnd what did you do then?â asked Holmes.

âI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that
if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,
Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
who were in need of it, I came right away to you.â

âAnd you did very wisely,â said Holmes. âYour case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you
have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at first sight appear.â

âGrave enough!â said Mr. Jabez Wilson. âWhy, I have lost four pound a
week.â

âAs far as you are personally concerned,â remarked Holmes, âI do not
see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On
the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£ 30, to say
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.â

âNo, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
their object was in playing this prankâif it was a prankâupon me. It
was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
pounds.â

âWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one
or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called
your attention to the advertisementâhow long had he been with you?â

âAbout a month then.â

âHow did he come?â

âIn answer to an advertisement.â

âWas he the only applicant?â

âNo, I had a dozen.â

âWhy did you pick him?â

âBecause he was handy and would come cheap.â

âAt half wages, in fact.â

âYes.â

âWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?â

âSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though heâs not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his
forehead.â

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. âI thought as
much,â said he. âHave you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?â

âYes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.â

âHum!â said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. âHe is still with
you?â

âOh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.â

âAnd has your business been attended to in your absence?â

âNothing to complain of, sir. Thereâs never very much to do of a
morning.â

âThat will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I
hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.â

âWell, Watson,â said Holmes when our visitor had left us, âwhat do you
make of it all?â

âI make nothing of it,â I answered frankly. âIt is a most mysterious
business.â

âAs a rule,â said Holmes, âthe more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.â

âWhat are you going to do, then?â I asked.

âTo smoke,â he answered. âIt is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg
that you wonât speak to me for fifty minutes.â He curled himself up in
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

âSarasate plays at the St. Jamesâs Hall this afternoon,â he remarked.
âWhat do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a fe weekâs work. It
was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I
was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.
Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to
leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would
not risk the loss of it.

âEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and
Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with
diligence that I might get on to the Bâs before very long. It cost me
something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.â

âTo an end?â

âYes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual
at ten oâclock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here
it is, and you can read for yourself.â

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
note-paper. It read in this fashion:

âTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED. October 9, 1890.â


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
of laughter.

âI cannot see that there is anything very funny,â cried our client,
flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. âIf you can do nothing
better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.â

âNo, no,â cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
had half risen. âI really wouldnât miss your case for the world. It is
most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying
so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you
take when you found the card upon the door?â

âI was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the
